Pattern issue:
LR App 2 doesn’t pattern match, but LR App 2.1 does. This isprobably because there is no content at LR App 2, but is it possible to set upa pattern that will take the user to the first place with content, i.e. LR App2.1?

Doc title: Prospectus requirements - financial information 
Doc ID: 119497 
Location: scroll down to the bottom of the Practice Note andyou’ll see that this happens for most of the right hand column links
Pattern issue: PR App 3.1.1 pattern matches but linksthrough to Rule 3.1.1.

---

We are experiencing issues with links to Appendices and
Annexes in the Listing Rules (LRs), Prospectus Rules (PRs) and
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTRs), all contained in the
FCA Handbook. 

You are already looking into our problem that links to the DTRs are not working at all and are just greyed out.

I would also now like to report that links to Appendices and Annexes in the LRs and PRs are not working properly – they are either greyed out or linking to the wrong material.

The issues experienced depend on the level of the reference, as follows (by reference to the LRs, but the same seems to apply to the PRs):

Appendix reference: LR App 2
Doesn’t work – greyed out.
Example: Directors’ remuneration report (Under main heading ‘Listing Rules requirements’, see section heading ‘Financial years ended before 30 September 2013’ – in the third paragraph see how LR App 2 does not link but LR App 2.1 does in the previous paragraph).

But strangely it does work if the reference is, for example, PR App 3 Ann 1, para 1.2 (see right hand column links in: Director’s responsibility letter—secondary offers (drafting notes)).

Appendix section reference: LR App 2.1
This links through correctly.
Example: Listing Rules requirements—the annual financial report (see section headed ‘Directors’ remuneration report’).

Appendix rule reference: LR App 3.1.1
Links through to the wrong material. 
Instead of linking through to Appendix Rule 3.1.1, it goes through to Rule 3.1.1.
Example: Prospectus requirements--financial information (scroll down to the bottom of the Practice Note and you’ll see that this happens for most of the right hand column links towards bottom of the Practice Note).

Annex to appendix: PR App 3.1.1 Ann 3
The Annex link doesn’t work (greyed out).
Example: Prospectus requirements--financial information (scroll down to the bottom of the Practice Note and you’ll see that this happens for most of the right hand column links towards bottom of the Practice Note – the same links where the App 3.1.1 link is going through to the main rule 3.1.1 rather than the appendix 3.1.1). 

I notice that you can link through to an Annex which is the annex to the main rules, rather than an annex to an appendix of the rules – see for example Board minutes of a listed company to convene a general meeting to authorise on-market share buybacks (drafting notes) – see the second right hand column link to Paragraph 2 (business of the meeting), which links to LR 11 Ann 1.

I’d be grateful if you could look into this as soon as possible.

Description of issue: Some of the grid lines are not showing as seen in the attached image.
I have tried recreating the table and applying the ff formulas in xml:
<row rowsep=""1"">
<entry colsep=""1"" rowsep=""1"">
<colspec colname=""col1"" colsep=""1"" colwidth=""1.00*""/><colspec colname=""col2"" 
Is this possible to be fixed?
There's no grid in the header row, the 'Key issues' row and the 'Other considerations' row when downloaded into word.

""Internet of things (IoT)—data protection, privacy and security""

Brings back recommends results from B&F and FS in relation to certain security documents which have nothing to do with this note. I don't think they would have intentionally added this term (it's the specific name of PN, for a start) to their Recommends.

- Dependent on research into whether we're keeping LR or not. 

- may get some attention now due to Pinsents engagement",Lexis Recommends,
