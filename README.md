# Asana2CSV

Simple app to access Asana task management system using a personal access token and export all the user's open tasks to csv format.

The personal access token can be generated through the Asana web portal. Go to My Profile Settings > Apps > Manage Developer Apps

Run .py file via the command line, navigate to the directory of the .py file, then run the program and give it the personal access token at the same time. 
Eg, type the following... 'asana2csv.py <personal-access-token>'
